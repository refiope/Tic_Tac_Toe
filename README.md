Complete version: finished on Mar. 8th 2018

Couple things to note:
  -I am not sure if this was the right way to go about this little project (having only one class, a module, and a tiny code of command that plays the game), but I went ahead anyway because there was no specific direction on how to create Tic Tac Toe, except for using OOP.

  -I tried to make classes as brief as possible, while modules got somewhat messy. The module.rb could have been a LOT MORE CLEAR if I did not use nested array. I should have used a single array with nine positions, but I already had nested array in mind when I started to write codes, so it was already too late by the time I finished. However, if I did wanted to change I don't think I have to touch the class codes, which I think it's a good thing.

  -I just want to move on to the next project so I deleted the empty board method for both class and module. I did double-check the edge case for the user input, so that should be enough for this game.
